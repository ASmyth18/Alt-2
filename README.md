# Alt-2
Data analysis project regarding the sloan digital sky survey.

The recommended way to run the alt 2 code is by importing it to kaggle but simply running vscode as long as you have jupyter installed is an alternative.

Please note that the catboost library is only available for python 3.10 and lower so if your pyhton version is 3.11 please run in kaggle

To install the libraries use pip install -r requirements.txt.

Oh and if you're confused about the 16 thousand lines of html too bad.
